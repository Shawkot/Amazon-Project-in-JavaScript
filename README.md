# Amazon-Project-in-JavaScript
This repo will contain all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a dummy front-end Amazon site.
I followed a YouTube tutorial titled "JavaScript Tutorial Full Course - Beginner to Pro (2024)"
from a channel SuperSimpleDev. The instructor, Simon is a wonderful teacher, he walked through from
naive to pro level, and refactored codes little by little.
While I do not solely write all the files and codes in this repo, I know very well what those code
means and how to develop them. I followed Simon throughout the course and now feel confident in JavaScript by developing 
the project along the tutorial.

Topics learned by doing this project are as follows:

- Core JavaScript language
	variables and scope
	loops
	conditions
	Array
	Functions
	Objects
  Destructuring

- MVC (model, view, and control)
- Object-oriented programming
	class
	objects
	constructors
	property and method (private and public)
- Asynchronous JavaScript:

	Async..await
- DOM API
- fetch API
- Error handling
	try....catch, throwing error, Error object
